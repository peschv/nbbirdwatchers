# nbbirdwatchers
A LAMP stack birdwatching website. Self-hosted on Apache (Linux) server implementing the eBird REST API, MySQL database, and phpBB forum.

While the server is not currently active (as it was run on an old laptop that is not always on), the below screenshots demonstrate how it functioned. The HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP code is also provided in this repo.
